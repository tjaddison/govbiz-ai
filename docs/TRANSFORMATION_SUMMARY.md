- **File contents**: All server instantiations and configurations verified

## New Capabilities Ready for Implementation

The platform is now ready to support additional capabilities:

### 1. Solicitations Capability (Ready to Implement)
```python
class SolicitationsCapability(Capability):
    # RFP/RFQ monitoring and proposal automation
    # Uses govbiz-solicitations-* agents
    # Integrates with existing MCP servers
```

### 2. Contract Vehicles Capability (Ready to Implement)
```python
class ContractVehiclesCapability(Capability):
    # GWAC, SEWP, and other contract vehicle tracking
    # Uses govbiz-contract-vehicles-* agents
    # Leverages search and monitoring infrastructure
```

### 3. Subcontracting Capability (Ready to Implement)
```python
class SubcontractingCapability(Capability):
    # Prime contractor opportunity identification
    # Small business teaming opportunities
    # Uses existing CRM and relationship management
```

## Technical Architecture Improvements

### SOLID Principles Implementation
- **Single Responsibility**: Each capability handles one contracting process
- **Open/Closed**: Platform open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: All capabilities implement same interfaces
- **Interface Segregation**: Clean, focused interfaces between components
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules depend on abstractions

### Key Framework Components
1. **Capability Interface**: Standard interface for all contracting capabilities
2. **Capability Registry**: Centralized management of available capabilities
3. **Configuration Management**: Capability-specific configuration with shared defaults
4. **Agent Patterns**: Reusable agent patterns across capabilities
5. **MCP Server Framework**: Standardized server implementations

### Resource Naming Strategy
- **Consistent prefix**: All resources use `govbiz-` prefix
- **Environment support**: `govbiz-{environment}-{resource}`
- **Capability scoping**: `govbiz-{capability}-{component}` where applicable
- **Backward compatibility**: Legacy mappings maintained during transition

## Deployment Considerations

### Migration Path
1. **Blue-Green Deployment**: Deploy new GovBiz.ai infrastructure alongside old
2. **Data Migration**: Copy data from old tables to new naming scheme
3. **Gradual Cutover**: Route traffic incrementally to new system
4. **Validation**: Comprehensive testing at each stage
5. **Cleanup**: Remove old resources after validation

### Configuration Updates Needed
- **AWS Secrets Manager**: Update paths from `sources-sought-ai/*` to `govbiz-ai/*`
- **AppConfig**: Update application name and capability configurations
- **Environment Variables**: Update any hardcoded resource names
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Update build and deployment scripts

### Database Migration
- **Table Renaming**: `ss-{env}-*` â†’ `govbiz-{env}-*`
- **Data Preservation**: All existing data maintained
- **Index Updates**: Update any hardcoded index names
- **Event Store**: Historical events preserved for audit
