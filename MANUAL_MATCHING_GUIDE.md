## üìã Best Practices

### 1. Profile Optimization
- **Keep documents current**: Upload latest capability statements
- **Complete profile information**: Fill out all company details
- **Refresh embeddings**: After any document changes
- **Review NAICS codes**: Ensure they accurately reflect your capabilities

### 2. Matching Strategy
- **Start with recent opportunities**: Use "Last 7 Days" batch matching
- **Test specific opportunities**: Use single match for high-priority opportunities
- **Monitor batch jobs**: Check progress regularly
- **Review low scores**: Understand why matches scored poorly

### 3. Performance Tips
- **Avoid overlapping batch jobs**: Wait for current jobs to complete
- **Refresh embeddings strategically**: Only when documents change
- **Use single match for testing**: Before running large batches
- **Monitor system health**: Check the dashboard for any issues
