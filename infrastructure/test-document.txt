Test Document for PyMuPDF Processing

This document should be processed with PyMuPDF 1.24.13 and python-docx 1.2.0

Company: Test Company Inc.
Capability: Software Development Services
NAICS Code: 541511

This is a test to verify that the new document processing libraries are working correctly after deployment.
The Lambda functions should now use:
- PyMuPDF 1.24.13 for PDF processing
- python-docx 1.2.0 for DOCX processing
- Amazon Textract as fallback for both

Previous processing attempts failed with "PyMuPDF not available" errors, which should now be resolved.
